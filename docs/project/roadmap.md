# Roadmap

This document outlines realistic future development plans for lawkit.

## Near-term Goals (Q1-Q2 2025)

### Package Distribution
- [x] **Rust crates.io**: Core and CLI packages published
- [x] **npm package**: JavaScript wrapper completion and publication  
- [x] **PyPI package**: Python wrapper completion and publication
- [ ] **Homebrew formula**: macOS package manager support

### Additional Statistical Laws
- [ ] **Weibull Distribution**: Reliability and survival analysis (moderate priority)
- [ ] **Log-Normal Distribution**: Financial and environmental data analysis
- [ ] **Beta Distribution**: Probability modeling (if community interest)

### Documentation & Quality
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks**: Publish detailed performance comparisons
- [ ] **Tutorial videos**: Basic usage demonstrations
- [ ] **API documentation**: Complete API reference hosting
- [ ] **Integration examples**: Real-world usage patterns

## Medium-term Possibilities (Q3-Q4 2025)

### Enhanced Features (if there's demand)
- [ ] **Configuration files**: YAML/TOML configuration support
- [ ] **Batch processing**: Multi-file analysis workflows
- [ ] **Report generation**: PDF/HTML summary reports
- [ ] **Simple visualization**: Basic chart generation

### Platform Support
- [ ] **Windows ARM**: Native ARM64 Windows binaries
- [ ] **Docker containers**: Official container images
- [ ] **CI/CD integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI examples

### Community Features
- [ ] **Plugin system**: Simple extension mechanism (if needed)
- [ ] **Custom thresholds**: User-defined risk levels
- [ ] **Output templates**: Customizable report formats

## Long-term Vision (2026+)

### Research Areas (exploratory)
- [ ] **Time series analysis**: Trend and seasonality detection improvements
- [ ] **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Correlation between multiple laws
- [ ] **Domain-specific optimizations**: Finance, manufacturing, research use cases

### Ecosystem Integration (community-driven)
- [ ] **Database connectors**: Direct SQL analysis (if requested)
- [ ] **Cloud storage**: S3/GCS integration (if needed)
- [ ] **Notebook integration**: Jupyter/Observable support

## Development Philosophy

### Realistic Approach
- **Focus on core competency**: Statistical law analysis
- **Maintain simplicity**: UNIX philosophy of doing one thing well
- **Community-driven priorities**: Features based on actual user needs
- **Quality over quantity**: Robust implementation over feature count

### What We Won't Do
- **Over-engineering**: Complex enterprise features without clear demand
- **Feature creep**: Adding features that don't serve the core mission
- **Platform lock-in**: Proprietary or vendor-specific implementations
- **Bloatware**: Heavy dependencies or complex installation requirements

## Contributing

### Priority Areas for Contributors
1. **Bug reports and fixes**: Most valuable contribution
2. **Documentation improvements**: Examples, guides, tutorials
3. **Performance optimizations**: Memory usage, speed improvements
4. **New statistical laws**: Well-researched mathematical implementations
5. **Platform support**: Testing on different systems

### How to Get Involved
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or suggest features
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions welcome
- **Documentation**: Help improve guides and examples
- **Testing**: Beta testing of new features
- **Feedback**: Real-world usage reports

## Release Philosophy

### Stable Releases
- **Semantic versioning**: Clear version number meaning
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain CLI compatibility
- **Thorough testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation updates**: Always accompany feature releases

### Release Cadence
- **Bug fixes**: As needed (patch versions)
- **Minor features**: Quarterly if ready (minor versions)
- **Major changes**: Yearly at most (major versions)

## Current Status

lawkit 2.1.0 represents a mature, stable statistical analysis toolkit. Future development will focus on:

1. **Stability and performance** over new features
2. **Community needs** over ambitious roadmaps
3. **Quality implementations** over rapid feature addition
4. **Real-world utility** over theoretical completeness

This roadmap is intentionally conservative and will evolve based on actual user needs rather than speculative features.
